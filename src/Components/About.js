      <p className='para'>Welcome to Food Hut, Kochi first sattvic cuisine restaurant. At Food Hut, we believe in food as a philosophy and vegetarianism as a way of life. Food Hut offers visitors a menu which is nothing short of divine. At Food Hut, the ambience, like the cuisine, is a refreshing mix of old and modern India. Rich mauve and purple motifs reflect the intricacies of Indian art and are complemented by dark mahogany and clean lines of modern design. A water cascade creates a soothing environment and adds a distinct note to the gentle music of the restaurant.<br></br>    
       We went to eat some snacks like Tandoori and lollypop but when we started eating we liked the taste very much and ordered the gravy item also. The taste was very good and Nan were also very soft. It is a nice family restaurant with good ambience inside and ample space. You will like the taste although its location is interior near Choti Haidrabad Gate.</p><br></br>
